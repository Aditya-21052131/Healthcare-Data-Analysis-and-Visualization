# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
The objective of this project is to build a data-driven tool that can analyze healthcare data to uncover trends, patterns, and potential anomalies. This tool will assist healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers in making informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

# Creating a complete healthcare data analysis and visualization project involves the following steps:

i.Importing Libraries

ii.Loading a Dataset

iii.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

iv.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

v.Applying Machine Learning Models

vi.Visualization Using Python (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

vi.Exporting Results/Building a Simple Dashboard
